Critical
--------

	
	* 	Url appears in view in triplicate 
	[[[FIXED @ git branch PVCC-CS1-Final, commit 32e6ab]]]

		--To Reproduce: 

			Try to use menu item #3 'List all Urls (ordered by category)' or #4 == urls by categroy appear in triples

			[3].  *List all* 'URLs' (ordered by Category)
			[4].  *List all* 'To Do' Items (ordered by Category)

		-- Possible code locations of error:

			>> Class Category Parser, Method associate (my money is on the logic being slightly off here)
			>> Class UiCli, Method viewUrlList

	* Signup/Signin selection process: Text entry kills execution.
	[[[?]]]

		--To Reproduce:

			Enter text instead of integers when choosing 1 or 2.

		-- To Fix:

			>> I fixed these issues elsewhere with try catch statements and boolean logic, I can do the same here.

	* Signup process: New line entry creates 'blank' username.
	[[[?]]]

		--To Reproduce:

			When entering username, just hit enter.

		-- To Fix:

			>> Apply conditional logic to circumvent blank entries.

	* Signin process/Username does not exist path: Text entry kills execution.
	[[[?]]]

		--To Reproduce:

			Enter text instead of integers when choosing 1 or 2.

		-- To Fix:

			>> I fixed these issues elsewhere with try catch statements and boolean logic, I can do the same here.	

	* [1] Manually Add a Browser Session File/Are you sure this is the correct file?: Text entry kills execution.
	[[[?]]]

Minor
-----
